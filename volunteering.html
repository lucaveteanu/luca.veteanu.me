                    I believe every kid should be exposed to coding in a way that connects with their own passions and interests. 
                    When coding is tied to things they already love, like games, art, or storytelling, it becomes a lot more fun and meaningful. 
                    Here are some of the initiatives I've had the privilege to be part of.

                            I co-founded and helped teach a comprehensive JavaScript and Game Development course 
                            at the South Regional/Broward College Library. This initiative brought coding education 
                            to the community, making it accessible to students who might not otherwise have the 
                            opportunity to learn programming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As an instructor assistant, I developed curriculum materials, led hands-on coding 
                            exercises, and provided one-on-one support to help students grasp challenging concepts. 
                            Watching students build their first games and see their code come to life has been 
                            incredibly rewarding.

                            Based on the success of the course at Broward Library, I initiated and co-taught another JavaScript course at the 
                            Alvin Sherman Library at Nova University. This partnership expanded our reach, 
                            allowing us to introduce even more students to the world of coding and game development.

                            I organized a coding club for younger students in the aftercare program at Embassy Creek Elementary School, where I introduced basic STEM and coding concepts through fun,                                 hands-on activities. I adapted and reused much of the teaching material from the previous coding sessions I led at Broward Library, tailoring it to be more visual and                                     interactive for elementary-aged learners.
