                    <p>
                        I'm excited to announce that I've co-founded a JavaScript and Game Development course at the South 
                        Regional/Broward College Library! This has been a dream of mine for a while, and seeing it come to 
                        life has been incredible. Here's how it all happened.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Idea</h2>
                    <p>
                        After learning JavaScript and building my own games, I wanted to share what I'd learned. But where 
                        do you start when you're a high school student? I couldn't exactly open my own coding school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then I realized: libraries! Libraries are community centers that offer all sorts of programs. Why 
                        not a coding class? I approached the South Regional Library with my idea, expecting to be turned 
                        away. Instead, they were enthusiastic.
                    </p>

                    <div class="blog-image">

                        <p class="image-caption">Class announcement at the library</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h2>Making It Happen</h2>
                    <p>
                        Turning an idea into reality required more work than I expected. I needed to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a curriculum that was engaging but not overwhelming</li>
                        <li>Design hands-on projects that students could complete in class</li>
                        <li>Prepare materials and resources for students to take home</li>
                        <li>Coordinate with library staff on scheduling and logistics</li>
                        <li>Promote the class to get students to sign up</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I worked with a friend who shared my passion for teaching, and together we built the course from 
                        scratch. We spent weeks refining our lesson plans, testing our projects, and preparing for every 
                        possible question students might ask.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Curriculum</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our course focuses on JavaScript because it's beginner-friendly and immediately rewarding. Students 
                        can see their code run in a web browser without installing anything complicated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We structured the course around building progressively more complex projects:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> JavaScript basics and drawing with code</li>
                        <li><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Interactive animations and user input</li>
                        <li><strong>Week 5-6:</strong> Building simple games like Pong</li>
                        <li><strong>Week 7-8:</strong> More complex game mechanics and final projects</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Every lesson includes hands-on coding time. We don't just lecture - we code together, debug together, 
                        and celebrate when things work.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The First Class</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was nervous on the first day. What if no one showed up? What if my teaching style didn't work? 
                        What if students found it boring? I arrived early, set up my laptop, and waited.
                    </p>

                    <div class="blog-image">
                        <img src="../assets/images/volunteering/class/IMG_6232.jpg" alt="Waiting for students to arrive">
                        <p class="image-caption">Waiting for students to arrive</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>
                        But when the time came, twelve students walked in excitedly. All my worries 
                        melted away. We introduced ourselves, talked about why we wanted to learn coding, and jumped right 
                        into writing our first JavaScript program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the end of the first session, every student had created a simple drawing program. They could 
                        click on the screen and draw colored circles. It was basic, but you should have seen their faces 
                        light up when they realized they'd just written their first program.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Challenges and Lessons</h2>
                    <p>
                        Teaching isn't as easy as I thought it would be. Students learn at different paces. Some grasp 
                        concepts immediately; others need more explanation. Some are comfortable with computers; others 
                        have never written code before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learned to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be patient and never make students feel bad for asking questions</li>
                        <li>Prepare extra challenges for fast learners</li>
                        <li>Break down concepts into smaller, digestible pieces</li>
                        <li>Use analogies and real-world examples to explain abstract ideas</li>
                        <li>Celebrate small victories - every working program is an achievement</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Impact</h2>
                    <p>
                        Seeing students progress from complete beginners to building their own games has been the most 
                        rewarding experience. One student created a space shooter game and showed it to her entire family. 
                        Another is now considering computer science as a college major.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But beyond individual success stories, what makes me proudest is creating a community. Our students 
                        help each other, share ideas, and encourage one another. They've formed a study group that meets 
                        even outside class time.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Expanding the Program</h2>
                    <p>
                        The success at South Regional Library led to opportunities at other locations. We've now started 
                        similar programs at the Alvin Sherman Library at Nova University and even in an elementary school 
                        aftercare program.
                    </p>

                    <div class="blog-image">
                        <img src="../assets/images/volunteering/class/IMG_4166.JPG" alt="Alvin Sherman Library">
                        <p class="image-caption">Alvin Sherman Library - where I teach coding</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>
                        Each location presents unique challenges and opportunities. Teaching elementary students requires 
                        different approaches than teaching teens. But the core mission remains the same: make coding 
                        accessible and fun for everyone.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Want to Start Your Own Class?</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you're passionate about something and want to teach others, here's my advice:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start local - libraries, community centers, and schools are always looking for volunteers</li>
                        <li>You don't need to be an expert - you just need to know more than your students</li>
                        <li>Start small and grow gradually</li>
                        <li>Prepare thoroughly, but be flexible - not everything will go as planned</li>
                        <li>Focus on engagement over perfection</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                    <p>
                        This journey has taught me that knowledge becomes more valuable when shared. Every student I help 
                        learn to code is someone who might go on to create amazing things, solve important problems, or 
                        teach others in turn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teaching coding at Broward Library started as a way to give back to my community. It's become so 
                        much more - a passion, a mission, and a glimpse of what I hope to do for the rest of my life.
                    </p>
