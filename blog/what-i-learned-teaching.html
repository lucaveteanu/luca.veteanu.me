                    <p>
                        When I started teaching JavaScript at libraries and schools, I thought my job was to transfer 
                        knowledge from my brain to theirs. I'd teach them variables, functions, and loops, and they'd 
                        become programmers. Simple, right? Turns out, I had no idea what I was getting into.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <h2>Lesson 1: Teaching Is Learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        I thought I knew JavaScript well until I had to explain it to someone else. When a student asks, 
                        "Why do we use semicolons?" or "What's the difference between let and var?" you can't just say 
                        "because that's how it works." You need to truly understand the why behind everything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teaching forced me to deepen my own knowledge. I had to learn concepts well enough to explain them 
                        in multiple ways, to create analogies, to answer questions I'd never considered. My students made 
                        me a better programmer by challenging me to understand things at a fundamental level.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lesson 2: Everyone Learns Differently</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some students grasp concepts through visual diagrams. Others need to write code and see it run. 
                        Some learn best through analogies to real-world situations. And some just need to struggle with a 
                        problem until they figure it out themselves.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="blog-image">
                        <img src="../assets/images/volunteering/whiteboard/IMG_6195.JPEG" alt="Teaching JavaScript concepts on the whiteboard">
                        <p class="image-caption">Using visual explanations and code examples on the whiteboard to teach JavaScript fundamentals</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        I learned to prepare lessons in multiple formats: visual slides, code examples, hands-on exercises, 
                        and real-world analogies. What clicks for one student might not work for another, and that's okay.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lesson 3: Mistakes Are the Best Teachers</h2>
                    <p>
                        In my early classes, I tried to prevent students from making mistakes. I'd give them perfect code 
                        to copy, step-by-step instructions to follow. But I noticed they weren't learning as well as I'd 
                        hoped.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then I tried something different. I let them make mistakes. I gave them challenges where getting it 
                        wrong was not only possible but expected. And magic happened. Students who struggled with a bug for 
                        ten minutes and finally fixed it remembered that lesson forever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now I actively design exercises where students will likely make certain mistakes. Then we debug 
                        together. It's more frustrating in the moment, but the learning sticks.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lesson 4: Enthusiasm Is Contagious</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I'm excited about what we're building, students get excited too. When I show genuine joy at 
                        solving a tricky problem or creating something cool, that energy spreads.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learned to bring enthusiasm to every class, even when teaching the same basic concepts for the 
                        tenth time. For me it might be review, but for each new student, it's their first time experiencing 
                        the magic of writing code that actually works.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lesson 5: Patience Is Everything</h2>
                    <p>
                        Concepts that seem obvious to me now were once completely foreign. I had to learn patience - with 
                        students who need extra time, with questions that seem basic, with errors that could have been 
                        avoided if they'd just read the instructions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I remind myself constantly: everyone starts somewhere. My job isn't to judge their current level; 
                        it's to help them get to the next level.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lesson 6: Practical Projects Beat Theory</h2>
                    <p>
                        Students don't care about variables and functions in the abstract. They care about building things. 
                        So we build things - games, animations, interactive websites - and learn the concepts through 
                        practical application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead of saying "today we'll learn about if statements," I say "today we'll make a game where your 
                        character can jump over obstacles." They learn if statements in the process, but the goal is the 
                        game, not the grammar.
                    </p>

                        <p class="image-caption">Build a fun mini game</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h2>Lesson 7: Community Matters</h2>
                    <p>
                        I used to think learning to code was a solitary activity. But the best learning happens in community. 
                        Students help each other, share discoveries, and celebrate each other's successes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I now intentionally build community in my classes. Pair programming, group projects, show-and-tell 
                        sessions where students present their work. Learning together is better than learning alone.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lesson 8: Confidence Is Half the Battle</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many students believe they "aren't good at coding" before they've even tried. They see programming 
                        as something for gifted geniuses, not regular people like them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of my most important jobs is building confidence. Celebrating small victories, normalizing 
                        mistakes, sharing my own struggles, and showing that everyone - including me - looks up error 
                        messages and searches for solutions online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a student goes from "I can't do this" to "I figured it out!" - that transformation in mindset 
                        is worth more than any technical skill.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lesson 9: Age Is Just a Number</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've taught elementary students and adults. I've worked with students who've never touched a 
                        computer and students who built their first website at age 8. The common thread? Curiosity and 
                        willingness to learn matter more than age or background.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of my best students have been those who came in thinking they were "too old" or "not technical 
                        enough." They proved themselves wrong.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lesson 10: I'm Still Learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        The most important lesson? I don't have all the answers, and that's okay. I learn something new in 
                        every class - a better way to explain a concept, a question I'd never considered, or a creative 
                        solution from a student I wouldn't have thought of.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teaching isn't about being the smartest person in the room. It's about creating an environment where 
                        everyone, including the teacher, can learn and grow together.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Real Reward</h2>
                    <p>
                        The best part of teaching isn't seeing students master JavaScript. It's seeing them discover that 
                        they can create, that they can solve problems, that they can learn hard things if they're willing 
                        to try.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a former student messages me to say they built something on their own, or that they're pursuing 
                        computer science in college, or that they taught their younger sibling to code - those moments make 
                        all the hard work worthwhile.
                    </p>

                    <h2>To Future Teachers</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you're thinking about teaching, whether it's coding or anything else, here's my advice: don't 
                        wait until you're an expert. Don't wait until you have all the answers. Start teaching, start 
                        learning, and grow with your students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You'll make mistakes. You'll have lessons that flop. You'll encounter questions you can't answer. 
                        That's all part of the journey. The students who remember you won't remember your perfect lessons; 
                        they'll remember that you cared, that you tried, and that you helped them believe in themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teaching coding to teens has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life. 
                        It's made me a better programmer, a better communicator, and a better person. And I'm just getting 
                        started.
